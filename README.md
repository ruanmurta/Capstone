COVID-19 Effects on the US Labor Market - The Monitoring App

This Monitoring Application provides an overview of the situation of the US labor market (unemployment and job opening rates) in face of 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic. This dashboard is built with R using the R Makrdown framework and was adapted from this dashboard by Rami Krispin.

Code

The code behind this dashboard is available on GitHub. In that repository you will also find a link for the application demo.

Data

The data and dashboard are dynamically refreshed (what you see is not static data).

The raw data used as input for the dashboards is extracted from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus database and U.S. Bureau Of Labor Statistics (blsAPI) database

This application was developed as a part of the Computer Science Capstone course at City University of Seattle - CityU

Course Policy on Publication & Dissemination: The final results of the research project are open to the public and available at CityU School of Technology & Computing (STC) Capstone Repository.
