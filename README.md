COVID-19 Effects on the US Labor Market - The Monitoring App

This Monitoring Application provides an overview of the situation of the US labor market (unemployment and job opening rates) in face of 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic. This dashboard is built with R using the R Makrdown framework and was adapted from this dashboard by Rami Krispin.
